# Methods

## Site Description

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater
  
  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultural diversions**

## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

### Data Download
```{r downloader}
q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')
```

### Static Data Plotter
```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')
```

### Interactive Data Plotter
```{r}
q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)
dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```


# Assignment
This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertise in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:

1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

5) Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document. 

## DyGraph example
```{r}
#Points and lines
dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y",label="Discharge (cfs)") %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints=TRUE,pointSize=1.5)

#Points only
dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y",label="Discharge (cfs)") %>%
  dyOptions(strokeWidth=0,drawPoints=TRUE,pointSize=1.5)
```

## Poudre Paragraph
**Fishing** is a popular way to enjoy the Poudre River year-round. Beside a handful of *natural preserves* along the river, most areas are open to fishers with a permit. Brochures from both [Colorado Parks & Wildlife](https://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Maps/CPW_FishingThePoudreCanyonBrochure.pdf) and [Fort Collins](https://www.fcgov.com/naturalareas/pdf/fishing-brochure16.pdf) share helpful guidelines and maps. Local enthusiast Max DesMarais has also created a [Google map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=183f1Ysk7y0pSBDv2nHQmlKWEmnnktagH&ll=40.52056167068769%2C-105.41546394820773&z=9) of nice spots. Many **trout** can be found in the Poudre, including rainbow, cutthroat, cutbow, and brown.
